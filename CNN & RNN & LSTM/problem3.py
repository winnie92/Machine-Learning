    Problem 3: Recurrent Neural Network 
    In this problem, you will implement the recurrent neural network for sequence classification problems.
    We will use cross entropy as the loss function and stochastic gradient descent to train the model parameters.
    You could test the correctness of your code by typing `nosetests test3.py` in the terminal.
    Note: please do NOT use torch.nn.RNN, implement your own version of RNN using only basic tensor operations.

        Note: please do NOT use th.nn.Tanh, th.tanh, th.nn.functional.tanh, implement your own version using basic tensor operations, such as exp(), div(), etc.
